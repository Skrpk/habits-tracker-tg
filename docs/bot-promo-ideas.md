there are a big community of crypto traders using telegram. they are active telegram users and they are ready to pay. how can i access this audience in tg with my product? Brainstorm some ideas


1) Positioning for crypto traders (what they’d actually pay for)
“Discipline OS”: habits/streaks framed as “process > outcome” for trading (journaling, risk rules, cooldowns).
Rule enforcement: “Did you follow plan?” “Max risk per trade?” “No revenge trades?” with daily check-ins.
Accountability loops: streaks + optional “public accountability” in a group.
Anti-tilt workflows: skip day without breaking streak = “rest day” / “no-trade day” that preserves discipline.
2) Where the audience already is (TG access paths)
Influencer/Channel owners: paid shoutouts in trading channels (signals, education, macro news).
Paid/private groups: partner with admins to embed your bot as an “official discipline bot”.
Communities + launchpads: “tooling” channels (trading tools, alpha groups, bot marketplaces).
Telegram bot catalogs: niche lists for crypto tools (less volume, high intent).
3) Partnership ideas that convert
Rev-share with group admins: unique referral links per channel, pay per activated paid user.
“Sponsored challenge”: Admin runs a 14/30-day discipline challenge; your bot tracks it; winners get perks.
White-label: “TraderXYZ Discipline Bot” for a single large group; they pay monthly.
Affiliate bundles: pair with journaling templates, trading courses, or analytics tools.
4) Growth mechanics inside Telegram (viral loops)
Group mode (big one): bot works in groups + leaderboard by streak, daily check-in prompt, weekly recap.
Shareable streak cards: auto-generated “I’m on day 17 of Risk Rules” as an image users can forward.
Referral rewards: unlock premium features (extra habits, advanced schedules, analytics) for invites.
“Forward to start” flows: user forwards the bot message to friends; deep link starts onboarding.
5) Product tweaks specifically for traders (premium hooks)
Pre-market routine habit pack: sleep, news scan, levels, plan, size rules.
Post-trade review pack: screenshots, mistakes, emotion rating, “followed plan?”.
“No-trade day” tracking: explicitly track rest/cooldown days (your skip feature is perfect here).
Risk rule reminders: scheduled reminders like “Max 1% risk” or “Stop after 2 losses”.
Weekly report: streaks + “discipline score” summary (export/shareable).
6) Monetization angles that fit crypto TG culture
Premium tier: analytics, templates, group leaderboards, export, multiple schedules, “coach mode”.
B2B: charge group owners/coaches (monthly) rather than individuals.
Pay-per-seat for private groups or coaching cohorts.
Trial-to-paid: 7-day discipline challenge free, then unlock more habit packs.
7) Acquisition plays (concrete campaigns)
“30-Day No Tilt Challenge”: partner with 5–10 mid-size TG channels; prize pool sponsored by channel.
“Discipline > Signals” contrarian campaign: educational posts + free bot starter kit.
Coach onboarding: target “trading psychologists/coaches” on TG; bot becomes their client tracker.
Micro-influencers: traders who post daily recaps; give them custom habit pack + referral code.
8) Trust + compliance (important in crypto circles)
No custody, no wallets, no trading signals (make it explicit).
Privacy: emphasize “no exchange keys”, minimal data, and clear terms.
Anti-spam: let admins control posting frequency in groups.
If you tell me your preferred model—sell to individuals vs sell to group admins/coaches—and whether you’re willing to add group mode + leaderboards, I can outline a tight go-to-market plan and a first 2-week outreach script set.
